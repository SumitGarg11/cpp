//C++ (pronounced see plus plus) was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs 
// as an extension to C, starting in 1979.

//C++ is designed to allow the programmer a high degree of freedom to do what they want. 
//Here are a few common types of applications that most likely would be written in C++:


// 1.Video games
// 2.Real-time systems
// 3.Graphical applications and simulations
// 4.Productivity / office applications
// 5.Embedded software
// 6.Audio and video processing
// 7.Artificial intelligence and neural networks

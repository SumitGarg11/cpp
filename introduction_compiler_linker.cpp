object file --> C++ source code into a 
machine language file

If your program had 3 .cpp files, the compiler would 
generate 3 object files:


  source file:     |     source file:
calculator.cpp     |    fraction.cpp
    |              |         |      
    |              |         |
  object file:     |     object file:
calculator.o       |    fraction.o

C++ also comes with an extensive library 
called the C++ Standard Library

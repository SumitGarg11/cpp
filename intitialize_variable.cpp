#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    int a; // no initializer (default initialization)
    int b = 7; // initializer after equals sign (
        // copy initialization)

    int c(9); // initializer in parenthesis
    //  (direct initialization)

    int d {9}; // initializer in 
    // braces (direct list initialization)

    int e = {0}; // initializer in braces 
    // after equals sign (copy list initialization)

    int f { };
     // initializer is empty braces (value initialization)

     Default initialization

When no initialization value is provided
 (such as for variable a above)
, this is called default initialization. 
In most cases, default initialization leaves 
a variable with an indeterminate value.

// cin and cout

-->cin is an object of the input stream 
 and is used to take input from input streams
 like files, console, etc. cout is an object of 
 the output stream that is used to show output. 
 Basically, cin is an input statement while cout 
 is an output statement. They also use different operators.
